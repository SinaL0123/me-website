    <h2>What is the story of your name</h2>
    <p>My name is Sina and my Chinese name is Shuning. My parent gave me the name because they want me to be a quiet
      girl
      who likes reading books. And I gave myself the English name based on my Chinese name's pronunciation.<br></p>
    <h2>what is an animal that represents you</h2>

    <p>My friend says I am like a <e>penguin</e> :) I personally thinks it's because he first met me in winter when I
      wear
      myself like a spongy ball. Another friend often says I look like a <e>chinchilla</e>.<br></p>
    <h2>what are two of your hobbies. describe what you like about them.</h2>
    <h3><i>Photography</i></h3>
    <img src="photography.jpg" style="display:block; margin:auto; width: 30%" ;>
    <p>One of my biggest hobbies is photography. I first started with a digital camera because it was easy to use and
      came
      with preset filters—perfect for someone like me who knew nothing about Photoshop. I really like Fujifilm, and my
      very first camera was a Fujifilm XT-30. I used to carry it almost everywhere when I traveled, and it always gave
      me
      satisfying results. Earlier this year, inspired by a friend, I switched to film photography. Surprisingly, I fell
      in
      love with it—the stunning colors and warm tones are something digital just can’t fully capture. I even dropped my
      cognition class this semester so I could take a film photography course instead, because I wanted hands-on
      experience in developing my own rolls. Overall, photography gives me a strong sense of fulfillment and
      accomplishment, especially when I manage to capture a fleeting moment of beauty through my viewfinder.</p> <br>
    <h3><i>Horror Movies</i></h3>
    <img src="horror.jpeg" style="display:block; margin:auto; width: 40%" ;>
    <p>My second hobby is watching horror movies. I especially enjoy cult classics and religion-themed horror films.
      Whenever I feel bored, I often search online for high-rated horror movies and then watch them alone under the
      blanket. Whether it’s well-known titles like The Shining, The Conjuring, It, and Smile, or more niche ones like
      Terrified and Incident in a Ghostland, I enjoy them all. What fascinates me most is the immersive atmosphere that
      horror films create—it makes me feel like I’m inside the story. I also love the rhythm of jump scares and the
      element of surprise. For me, the most exciting part is that even when I’m mentally prepared, I still end up
      getting
      scared, and that’s exactly what makes horror movies so powerful and fun to watch<br></p>
    <h2>what are you excited to learn about the world?</h2>
    <p>really excited to learn how stereotypes sometimes clash with reality, especially when people from different
      cultural backgrounds interact and share their experiences. I also want to see the places I’ve only read about in
      textbooks but never visited in person. Another thing I’m looking forward to is discovering different restaurants
      and trying all kinds of food. And finally, I’d love to challenge myself with sports, games, or experiences that I
      haven’t tried yet.</p>
    <h2>what is your favorite song?</h2>
    <img src="song.jpg" style="display:block; margin:auto; width: 30%" ;>
    <p><i>First Love</i> by Hikaru Utada. I first came across it in 2022 when I watched the Japanese drama First Love,
      and ever since then I’ve really loved the song.</p>
    <h2>what is your favorite food?</h2>
    <img src="hunan-cuisine.jpg" style="display:block; margin:auto; width: 50%" ;>
    <p>My favorite food is Xiang cuisine, also known as Hunan food. I really enjoy its bold flavors, spiciness, and the
      way it combines heat with rich seasonings.</p>
    <h2>something unexpected</h2>
    <img src="hamster.jpg" style="display:block; margin:auto; width: 30%" ;>
    <p>Something unexpected about me is that I have a pet hamster named Annie. She’s very small and adorable, and taking
      care of her has become part of my daily routine. Even though she’s tiny, she has a big personality—she loves
      running on her wheel at night and stuffing her cheeks with food. Watching her little habits always makes me smile
      and helps me relax after a busy day.</p>
